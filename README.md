### What is the 10 PRINT?
`10 print chr$(205.5+rnd(1)) goto 10` is a famous single line of code (in BASIC) which can produce some very interesting looking maze-like designs.

### Where did i hear about it?
I first heard about it on one of the [The Code Train Live Videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw).

### Why did i build this page?
As a junior developer, i am looking for ways to learn in a fun and productive way.
I thought that making my own version of the *10 PRINT* would be a nice way to improve my skills.
